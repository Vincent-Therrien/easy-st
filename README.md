This repository contains tools that aim at simplifying and automating tasks
in spatial transcriptomics on Linux. It contains the following:

- The **pipelines** directory comprises Jupyter notebooks that analyse spRNA-seq
  and scRNA-seq data using the `scanpy` and `squidpy` libraries.
- The file **sr-helper.py** is a Python script that simplifies the use of
  `space ranger`, a software tool that processes the raw data of Visium samples.
  Execute the command `python3 sr-helper.py help` for more information.
